### New Folder Structure

```text
commands/
├── plan/           # Planning
│   ├── make_plan.md
│   └── review_order.md
├── dev/            # Development execution
│   ├── execute_plan.md
│   ├── save_temp.md
│   └── finish_order.md
├── quality/        # Quality assurance
│   ├── refactor.md
│   └── l10n.md
└── doc/            # Documentation
    ├── commit_log.md
    └── finish_sprint.md
```

### Terminology Updates

| Before | After | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| ORDER file | PLAN file | Output document |
| orderMMDDNN.md | planMMDDNN.md | File naming |
| execute_order | execute_plan | Command name |

### Modified Files

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Complete rewrite with new structure |
| `commands/plan/make_plan.md` | Updated description, terminology |
| `commands/plan/review_order.md` | Rewritten with clear role definition |
| `commands/dev/execute_plan.md` | Renamed, updated references |
| `commands/dev/finish_order.md` | Updated PLAN references |
| `commands/dev/save_temp.md` | Updated PLAN references |
| `commands/doc/finish_sprint.md` | Updated PLAN references |
| `result.md` | Updated with completion status |

### Deleted Files

- `commands/plan/execute_order.md` (renamed to dev/execute_plan.md)
- `commands/plan/finish_order.md` (moved to dev/)
- `commands/plan/save_temp.md` (moved to dev/)
- `commands/release/refactor.md` (moved to quality/)
- `commands/release/l10n.md` (moved to quality/)

## Impact

- All command invocations using `/plan:execute_order` should now use `/dev:execute_plan`
- Document naming convention changed from `orderMMDDNN.md` to `planMMDDNN.md`
- Clearer separation between user request (ORDER) and analyzed plan (PLAN)

## Test Verification

- [ ] Verify symlink installation works with new structure
- [ ] Confirm all command files are properly linked
