style: fix markdown lint errors across all documentation

Fix markdown lint errors across the entire project by adding proper formatting
and creating exception rules for impractical lint rules.

Changes:
- Add .markdownlint.json with exceptions for MD013, MD060, MD041
- Add language specifier (text) to fenced code blocks without language
- Add trailing newline to files missing them
- Add blank lines around lists, headings, and fenced code blocks
- Fix ordered list prefix numbering (MD029)
- Update 17 markdown files with proper formatting
