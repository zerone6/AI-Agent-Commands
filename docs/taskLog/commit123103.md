feat: update Gemini workflow installation and clean up deprecated logic

- Implement global Gemini workflow installation to ~/.gemini/antigravity/global_workflows
- Support combined filenames (folder__file.md) for workflows
- Add specific backup logic for global workflows with MMYYDD format
- Remove deprecated ~/.gemini/commands symlinking and backup logic
- Update AGENTS.md with Sprint Structure and Commands Reference
- Simplify GEMINI.origin.md and rebuild GEMINI.md and CLAUDE.md
```

## Type

`feat`

## Changes Summary

### Technical Improvements

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Global Workflows** | Workflows are now copied to a global directory for centralized management. |
| **Filename Flattening** | Folder names are prefixed to filenames (e.g., `dev__execute_plan.md`) to avoid collisions in a flat structure. |
| **Backup Management** | Automated backup for global workflows using the `MMYYDD` format. |
| **Code Cleanup** | Removed legacy symlinking logic that is no longer compatible with the new structure. |

### Modified Files

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `install_command.sh` | Major update to `install_gemini` and path definitions. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Added Sprint Structure and Commands Reference sections. |
| `GEMINI.origin.md` | Simplified content to delegate rules to `AGENTS.md`. |
| `GEMINI.md` | Rebuilt with updated rules and removed legacy command paths. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Rebuilt to include updated global rules. |

## Impact

- Gemini workflows are now correctly installed in the global `global_workflows` directory.
- Users can easily manage and backup global workflows.
- Cleaned up the installation script by removing obsolete logic.

## Test Verification

- [x] Verified workflow copying to global directory.
- [x] Verified backup creation with `MMYYDD` format.
- [x] Verified that `~/.gemini/commands` is no longer created.
- [x] Verified built files (`GEMINI.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) reflect rule updates.
